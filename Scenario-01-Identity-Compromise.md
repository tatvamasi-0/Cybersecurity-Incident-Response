The Scenario opens with a bank named 'BankX' and a tech service provider company 'TechA'.
TechA provides all the technological services required for onlines services to the BankX.
Representing TechA we had the CEO, CIO, CTO, Techlead of the service, and emp y.
Representing BankX we had the CEO, CISO, Security Analyst, CFO and PR head.
Unfortunately TechA has an security incident and there has been a breach of PII data of about 5000 customers of BankX.
Now we have to create a playbook of each persons roles and responsibilities. 
The news about breach had been inittially contained, but eventually it was leaked to the public news by emp y of the TechA.
Now both TechA and BankX have to discuss about the breach and have to figure out how to deal with the breach.
